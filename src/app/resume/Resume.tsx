      Worked with strategists and designers to understand and evaluate an
      organization’s current systems, processes, and technologies to develop
      strategies which enhanced what was working well and provided solutions
      where gaps existed. For many clients, we built robust cloud and
      micro-service solutions.

      As a lead frontend engineer I worked on two major initiatives. The first
      was to build a new modern WordPress theme which was rolled out to over
      2000+ websites on the product platform. The new theme added responsive
      support and extensive customizations resulting in a significant increase
      of traffic. The second initiative was to optimize the company’s
      advertising platform to enhance performance on available ad slots and
      ultimately increase CTR for customers and ROI for the company.
